Puma
====

This library supposed to be used in ExpressJS based projects, and mainly oriented on former Zend Framework developers. It has similar dispatching and routing processes, uses controllers. Does not have any views and models section, because I wanted to keep it as small as possible. It allows to build modular API services and has bootstrapping middle-ware to serve static contend for one-page applications.

There is a JSDoc generated [documentation](http://nkbt.github.com/puma/docs/index.html), that covers all publicly available methods with relevant usage examples.

I develop and support it in my spare time and plan to use for my future personal projects.
